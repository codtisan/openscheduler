## Features
- Create and manage workflows with a user-friendly ReactJS interface.
- Schedule and monitor tasks with real-time updates.
- Scalable backend powered by Golang Fiber for high performance.
- Fast development and build process with BunJS and Vite.
- RESTful API for seamless frontend-backend communication.
- Modular and extensible architecture for easy customization.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development and builds.
  - [BunJS](https://bun.sh/) - JavaScript runtime and toolkit for efficient development.
- **Backend**:
  - [Golang](https://go.dev/) - Programming language for robust and efficient backend services.
  - [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) - Express-inspired web framework for Go, optimized for performance.
- **Database** (optional, specify your database if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB):
  - Currently supports [add your database here] for persistent storage.
- **Other Tools**:
  - [Add any additional tools or libraries here, e.g., Docker, Redis, etc.]

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [BunJS](https://bun.sh/) (v1.x or higher)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or higher, for Vite compatibility)
- [Golang](https://go.dev/) (v1.21 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning the repository
- [Optional: Add database or other dependencies here]

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/open-scheduler.git
   cd open-scheduler
   ```

2. **Set up the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   bun install
   ```

3. **Set up the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Copy the example environment files:
     ```bash
     cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
     cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
     ```
   - Update the `.env` files with your configuration (e.g., API keys, database credentials, port numbers).

5. **Start the development servers**:
   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     bun run dev
     ```
     The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or as configured in Vite).
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     go run main.go
     ```
     The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8080` (or as configured in Fiber).

6. **Optional: Set up the database**:
   - [Add database setup instructions here, e.g., running migrations, seeding data.]

## Usage
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the Open Scheduler frontend.
2. Use the interface to create and manage workflows.
3. The backend API exposes endpoints for workflow management. Example endpoints:
   - `GET /api/workflows` - List all workflows.
   - `POST /api/workflows` - Create a new workflow.
   - `PUT /api/workflows/:id` - Update a workflow.
   - `DELETE /api/workflows/:id` - Delete a workflow.
   - Refer to the [API documentation](#api-documentation) for full details.

### API Documentation
- [Add details or link to API documentation, e.g., Swagger or Postman collection.]
